# Changelog

## 0.10.3 - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- Restored macOS terminal IME behavior and added an OpenCode CLI install hint.

## 0.10.1 - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- Fixed the transient macOS WebKit `Paste` prompt when pasting into terminal panes.
- Improved terminal input ordering so keyboard input, paste, and submit actions do not interleave.
- Added a macOS terminal input fallback for cases where the first printable character is seen by the DOM but not forwarded by xterm.
- Cleaned noisy shell PATH output before it is cached, preventing restored-session text from breaking Claude/Codex environment detection.
- Scoped macOS-only terminal callout and context-menu handling away from Windows.

### Changed

- Terminal input trace logs now use debug-level logging to avoid noisy release logs.
